### **Sections Explained:**

1. **Usage**:  
   Provide instructions for cloning, setting up, and using the project locally.

2. **Contribution**:  
   Explain how others can contribute to the project. Using a simple guide with Git commands helps potential contributors.

3. **License**:  
   Mention the license you're using (e.g., MIT License) and create a `LICENSE` file in your repository. You can generate a license from GitHub directly when creating a new repo.

If you havenâ€™t decided on a license yet, you can choose one based on how you want others to use your code. The **MIT License** is a popular choice, allowing people to use, modify, and distribute your code as long as they give credit to the original author.
